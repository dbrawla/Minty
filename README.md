🍃 Minty – Gamified Budgeting App

A HackDavis 2025 project designed to make saving money fun, social, and motivating.

Minty turns personal budgeting into a game by allowing users to grow a virtual plant as they meet their savings goals.
Designed and built by a 3-person team during the 24-hour HackDavis hackathon, Minty combines behavioral psychology, UI design, and smart data handling to help students stay financially aware.

🌱 Project Overview

Minty helps users:

Track spending across custom categories

Receive smart budgeting suggestions

Set savings goals

Grow a personalized virtual plant as they save

Stay engaged through simple gamification

Minty was created to address a common issue among students: traditional budgeting apps feel boring and overwhelming. Minty flips that experience into something fun, visual, and rewarding.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: Figma (UI/UX design), JavaScript (for prototype logic)
Backend: PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs
Other Tools: Axios, Google Forms (user research), Notion (planning), Hackathon tools

👩‍💻 My Contributions

During HackDavis, I contributed to Minty's product experience, backend planning, and user research:

✨ UX/UI Design

Designed a mobile-first Figma prototype with a friendly, accessible visual style

Created key screens: home dashboard, savings goals, virtual plant garden, spending breakdown

✨ User Research & Product Validation

Conducted 50+ survey responses using Google Forms

Extracted insights on spending habits, pain points, and motivation

Used findings to guide feature prioritization (custom categories, suggestions, plant growth)

✨ Pitch & Collaboration

Helped organize the Devpost submission

Contributed to planning docs and project scope

🧠 Why Minty?

Budgeting is fundamental—especially for students—but existing apps are either too complex or too dull.
Minty reframes saving into a playful experience, using positive reinforcement and simple interactions to increase engagement.
